# The only recipe guide you'll ever need for pizza
_Pizza_. A combination of water, flour and yeast that was born out of a kitchen in naples has gone on to become a worldwide phenomenon. Just about everyone and their dog has an opinion on what the superior choice of pizza is. Ask anyone and you'll be greeted with a myriad of answers.

_Meatlovers_, _Hawaiian_, _Pepperoni_, _Thin Crust_, _Deep Dish_, _Detroit Style Deep Dish_. - All of which are very popular choices.

To tell you the truth if the answer isn't a Margherita, then i suggest walking away because it is now **abundantly** clear that you have been dealt the misfortune of conversing with what is a terrible person who has terrible taste.

Today I'll walk you through the only recipe you'll ever need for pizza. 

## Ingredients

I know what you're thinking, _Margherita?? How boring!_

Well my response to that is, those who know, _know_. And what i mean by that is, what makes the margherita so good lies not only in the technique but just as importantly, the ingredients. Be prepared to hit up some speciality shops in places you didn't know existed. Leave your jars of dolmio or bags of nondescript shredded cheese at the door.

As i mentioned above, you will need to go to atleast one speciality or wholesale shop to purchase at the very least good quality dough. The secret to good pizza in general is high quality _high protein_ flour, which unfortunately is usually only available through a specialty shop or commercial wholesaler. AP flour lacks the gluten development that gives traditonal neopolitan pizza it's signature texture and chew that i find so satisfying and addictive. If there's one ingredient I would stress not to cheap out on, **it's the flour**. 

While I place a high level of emphasis on the flour. Quality tomatoes are fortunately much easier to come by. My go to for good canned tomatoes are Solania's San Marzano tomatoes. luckily, you can order this online as quite a few online retailers do stock this. Alternatively if you think having canned tomatoes delivered to your house is a bit wanky (fair enough). Then Mutti's San Marzano tomatoes are available at Woolies and Harris Farms. 

In saying that, Mutti's regular whole peeled tomatoes will suffice. 

Try to be exact with the amount of water you add as too little can result in a drier pizza and too much can result in a pizza that's harder to shape. 

## Making the actual pizza

Strap in because this is going to take a while. Rome wasn't built in a day and neither is good pizza. 

Ok that was partially a lie. While you can go from flour to finished pizza all within 24 hours but I wouldn't as more time spent fermenting the dough is what will yield a tastier pizza. 

### Tomato Prep work

1. Crush the tomatoes either by hand or with a stick blender. Try not to over blend as this can ruin the flavour.

2. Add in salt, garlic, olive oil and black pepper to taste. 

3. Let it sit in the fridge overnight. This allows the flavour of the garlic and olive oil to infuse with the tomatoes.

### Mixing

1. Start by combining your flour, water, and yeast into a bowl and mixing until the all the ingredients are incorporated, it doesn't have to be kneaded and smooth. What we're looking for here is a shaggy collection of Flour, water and yeast. (If you have a stand mixer then let that mix on low for around 8-10 minutes on medium low or the 2nd setting if you own a Kitchen-Aid)

2. If you're using a stand mixer, add the salt in after roughly 6-7 minutes, then let it knead until you can't see any flakes of salt anymore and the dough appears smooth to the touch. 

> If hand mixing follow this, otherwise, knead and go straight to bulk ferment.

2. Once everything is incorporated, Cover the bowl with cling wrap and let it rest for an hour. This step is called autolyse and takes the hard work out of kneading. As the yeast begins to feed on the flour and water, it generates tiny bubbles of carbon dioxide that essentially knead the dough for you. 

3. After an hour you'll notice that what was previously very stiff and shaggy dough has relaxed into a workable piece of pizza dough. You can know hand knead this for 10-12 minutes. Try to do this in a cold room as the heat from your hands can kill your yeast which will prevent the pizza from forming that signature puffy crust. 

> A good way to tell if your dough is ready, is to take a small chunk and strech it into the shape of a square. If you can see light passing through with minimal tearing, then you're done kneading! I would rather you underknead than overknead as overkneaded dough can lead to a tougher more dense product. The bulk ferment will takecare of any last issues if you've underkneaded.

> This will yield 4 11-12 inch pizzas

### Bulk ferment

1. On a clean and lightly floured work surface, Start by cutting the ball into 4 even pieces or if you're wanting to be precise, 270 gram pieces. 

2. Once you've got your dough roughly cut into 4 even sections, start to fold the edges of the dough under itself. It's much easier hold the dough upside down while you do this as gravity takes care of most of the work. This is called balling the dough and helps to give the pizza it's signature shape. The aim here is to ball the dough so that the surface is nice and taut. You should only need to fold 3-4 times in order to achieve a smooth surface. Be sure to pinch the bottom of the all together to prevent any air bubbles from forming. The easiest method is to pinch the center of the base with your thumb and index finger while turning the dough 1/4 each pinch

3. You can either store the dough balls in their own separate containers or in a big plastic container. Something like this will do:

4. Store in the fridge, either overnight or ideally from 24-48 hours. 

### Pizza Day

1. Pre heat your oven to as high as it can go. Ideally if you have an oven that can reach 350-400 C, you're in business. Bonus points if you have a baking stone. 

2. Start by gently freeing the dough from it's container. You can dust a little flour over the dough and use a bench scraper or dough cutter to free the dough from the 4 edges of the container. From there, simply lift the dough onto a floured work surface face side down. give the bottom a heavy dusting of flour and turn it right side up again.

3. Using your fingertips, press down in the center of the dough. Gradually work your way outward, flattening the dough into a small disc.

4. Pick up the dough and drape it over your knuckles. Gently stretch the dough, using the back of your hands and knuckles to avoid tearing. Rotate the dough as you stretch it to keep an even circular shape. If you're feeling brave, you can try to toss the pizza. 

5. Add the sauce and cheese with a drizzle of olive oil and grated cheese, you've gotta work fast as the dough tends to stick to whatever surface you're working on, making it infinitely harder to transfer it to the oven.

6. Transfer the pizza to the oven and let it bake until done. If you have an oven that can hit 350-400 C, give it 2-3 minutes. Otherwise 6-7 minutes.

7. Yank the sucker out of the oven and onto a board. Slice it up however you want and devour. Drop some basil, extra grated cheese or olive oil over the top if you want.


## Finishing notes
So at this point, you're probably saying to yourself _Whole lotta effort for pizza huh?_ While that's true, Let me say that it'll be all worth it when you're able to turn out world class pies like this from the comfort of your own home:
